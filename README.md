# Pulse Multi-Monitor

A Laravel-based centralized dashboard for monitoring multiple Laravel applications using **Laravel Pulse**.

This project helps you monitor the performance of several Laravel apps (across multiple servers) through a single application, collecting metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage.

## Features
- Monitor multiple Laravel apps across different servers.
- Visualize system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage including slow queries(as stated in **Laravel Pulse**).
- Set up alerts when metrics exceed thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).

## Requirements
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Laravel 11.x
- MySQL or other databases (need to be configured in env)
- Composer

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pulse-multi-monitor.git

## Contributing
I am not an expert hence would be grateful to have some hands over this project. Due to lack of knowledge on setting up github properly in terms of contributions, would be great if anyone can help me with that.
